# Reto3/ university assignment 

This was a mini project from university (HTML & CSS course).

The teacher provided the details of the website (images, fonts, text, etc.) and a screenshot of the website. My task was to replicate it or make it as similar as possible.

The website will consist of only one HTML document with different sections and a navigation menu to access each of them.

Therefore, the site will be composed of a single HTML file (index.html) and a single CSS file (style.css).


I also had to check whether the colour combinations were accessible according to the WCAG 2.0 AA guidelines. If they were not accessible, I needed to modify them to ensure they were.

Additionally, I had to validate the HTML and CSS.
